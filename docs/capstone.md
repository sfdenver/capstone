# Capstone Project:
## luvmyride

**_Project Purpose: Simplify doing the right car maintenance at the right time, based on on how you use your car and how well you want to maintain it_**

## The challenge
- A car is the most expensive disposable good someone ever owns
- Maintenance records are difficult to keep
- Manufacturer's standard maintenance intervals are overly simplistic and hard to use
- Most people count on "their car" or windshield tags to help them remember when to change their oil
-- Mechanics then tell them what else to do - and hopefully are correct
-- When things break - new cars give some advice - but it's too late for preventive maintenance
- 
## The future, to make things simple
- Identify target maintenance based on how someones drives their cars
- Automatically track service location when maintenance is performed
- Encourage timely maintenance with user selected personnas - from comic to drill sargeant - to nagging parent
- Factor 
-
